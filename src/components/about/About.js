    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer with a special interest in Front-end Development. My previous experience within Human Resources and Recruitment equipped me detail-oriented skills. Such skills proved essential when completing my Web Development Bootcamp, as breaking down large projects into smaller components was imperative for success. During my bootcamp program, I further grew and strengthened my skills as a Web Developer, learning front and backend technologies; such as, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, React.js, Node.js, RESTful API, and PostgreSQL.
